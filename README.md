# HA Darmstadt & OAMK co-operation project

## Using Git

In these project, your the main branch of your repository is protected. So, you can not push directly to main. Instead you have to create a local branch and then push to that branch. When you want to merge to main, you have to create a **pull request** in GitHub. Then some other member/members in the group should check your code and if they accept that, they will merge it to the main.

You can find instructions of this system from  https://peatutor.com/git_tutor/git_project.php

## GitHub project

You can use the Project-section of your GitHub-repo as a Kanban board.
